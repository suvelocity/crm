## Stack

- Front end: React TypeScript
- Back end: NodeJs(Express) TypeScript MySQL(ORM:[Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/master/index.html))

## Setup

1. Clone the repo to your machine

2. Go to the project directory

### server

1. Run `cd server; npm install` to install backend dependencies.  
   This could take a bit of time, you may use it to call you mother, she worries.

2. Create a schema in mySQL (Docker/local), call it what you like (defaults to "crm")
3. Create a backend `.env` file. An [example](server/example.env) file is provided.
4. Edit `.env`.

```js
PORT = 8080; // the port the server will run on
MYSQL_USER = "<DB user>"; // defaults to "root"
MYSQL_PASSWORD = "<your password>";
MYSQL_DATABASE = "<you db schema name>"; // defaults to "crm"
MYSQL_HOST = "127.0.0.1"; // default localhost, depends if you run your db on a Docker
NODE_ENV = "development";
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET = "<your secret>";
REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET = "<another secret>"; // strings used in token creation
EMAIL_USER = ""; // mail used to send user confirmation messages
EMAIL_PASSWORD = "";
;
```

5. Run `npm run migrate` to migrate all required tables into your schema. This could take a while, you can try meditation.
1. Run `npm run dev` to start the server in dev mode (nodemon hot reload)

### client

1. Run `cd client; npm install` to install frontend dependencies

1. Create a client `.env` file. An [example](client/example.env) is provided.

1. Edit `.env`, add what you need.

```js
REACT_APP_API_KEY = ""; // google api key for location services
```

- If you have changed `PORT` in the server [`.env`](server/example.env), you need to change the `proxy` property in the client [`package.json`](client/package.json)

4. Run `npm start` to start react in development mode
5. To log into the service oyu need credentials, contact your local admin to get them

## Contributing

1. Decide on the feature you are working on

1. Start a new branch with a nice descriptive name

   - **good name**: `add-message-system`
   - **bad name**: `Shahar-cool-branch-23`

1. Develop the feature. Try to only work on one feature in a branch for ease of merging.

1. commit often, and name the commits descriptively

1. When you have finished work on your feature, create a PR to **dev** and stop working on the branch.

1. If you need the new feature to continue, branch out from your branch and continue in that branch. Else - just start a new branch

1. Alert @AlonBru that you have finished work and expect some questions about it

1. Once the PR is merged, the branch may be deleted.

## Database Tables

If you need to create a [new table](#new-table) or [modify an existing one](#modifying), always consult @Alonbru.  
you'll need to create a new migration or model, then [migrate](#migration) them to the DB.

### new table:

To create a new table, first create a new **model**:

```cmd
npx sequelize model:create --name <model name> --attributes <attribute>:<type>,<attribute>:<type>,<attribute>:<type> --underscored true
```

This generates a new **model** in the [models](server/models) dir, and a **migration** in the [migrations](server/migrations) dir.

- Don`t forget deleted_at.
- Using `--underscored true` makes the timestamp columns (createdAt,updatedAt) to be `camelCased` in the model but `snake_cased` in the migration and table (created_at,updated_at).  
  Sadly it does not work for all the column names, so you'll have to go and change them manually to be underscored in the migration. [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wmaurer.change-case) can help with that.
- In the model-init add to the object: tableName with the model name + s (for example if the model name is User the tabelName would be Users), paranoid: true.
- [more options](pics/cli-model-options.png)

 <!-- 
 may need more rules to add:
 paranoid
 table name
  -->

### modifying:

To add new columns to an existing table create new **migration**. a use:

```cmd
npx sequelize migration:create --name <model name> --underscored true
```

then edit the new migration to add the columns you need.

### migration

once the migrations are ready, use `npx sequelize db:migrate` to migrate all new changes to the DB.
